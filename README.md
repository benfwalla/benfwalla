**Ben "The Code Crusader" Wallace: Lord of the LLMs and King of the Next.js Kingdom**

**Subtitle:**

* Master of the Dark Arts (of coding)
* Lord of the LLMs (Language Models, duh!)
* King of the Next.js Kingdom (just kidding, but I do love Next.js)

**Hello, fellow coders**

Welcome to my humble abode on GitHub I'm Ben Wallace, a software engineer by day and a Stratechery article chatbot enthusiast by night. When I'm not coding, I'm probably trying to convince my wife that I'm not wasting my time building chatbots that talk about tech articles.

**My Projects:**

* **BenThompsonChatbot**: An LLM app that lets you chat with Stratechery articles. Because who needs human conversation when you can talk to Ben Thompson's articles?
* **firstmover-api**: A mysterious API that I'm still working on. Don't ask me what it does, I'm still figuring it out.
* **me**: My personal portfolio site, where I showcase my coding skills and pretend to be a real developer.
* **BookBlend**: A project that's still a work in progress. Let's just say it's a book recommendation engine that's still blending its ingredients.
* **nextjs-fastapi**: A Next.js and FastAPI project that's still in its infancy. Think of it as a baby that's still learning to crawl.

**GitHub Stats:**

* 34 repositories: Because who needs fewer repositories, right?
* 4 public gists: I'm a private person, but I guess I'm not that private.
* 17 followers: Thanks for following me, folks I'll try not to disappoint you.
* 23 following: I'm following a lot of people, but I'm not sure what I'm following them for.

**Achievements:**

* I've spent over 100 hours building a chatbot that talks about tech articles. I'm not sure if that's a badge of honor or a cry for help.
* I've written over 10 lines of code that don't contain any typos. It's a miracle, I know.
* I've successfully deployed a Next.js app to a FastAPI server. Okay, it was a simple app, but still!
* I've read over 100 Stratechery articles. I'm not sure if that's a testament to my dedication to learning or my ability to procrastinate.

**Check out my projects and maybe even contribute to them**

I promise not to make you talk to a chatbot that talks about tech articles (unless you want to, in which case, I've got a chatbot for you).

**Generated by an AI, because I'm too lazy to write this myself.**

Disclaimer: This README was generated by a language model, which means it's probably not as funny or witty as I think it is. But hey, at least it's not a chatbot that talks about tech articles.
